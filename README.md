# Marker

Marker is a minimalistic markdown based note taking app. It's heavily inspired from Notable, and Joplin Notes. Marker is designed to remember exactly where you last left off so you never lose your place, and stores all of it's data in non-proprietary file formats.

The app itself is currently under double secret ~~probation~~ alpha development and not yet ready for use. The current roadmap estimates version 1.0.0 will be ready by July.
