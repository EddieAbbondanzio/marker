A note taking app shouldn't get in your way. I wrote Marker because I wanted a markdown note taking app that would make me more productive while at the same time giving me full control control over my notes.

## Features

- Fully custom shortcuts. Don't like a shortcut? Disable it. Want to change the keys? Sure, why not. Want to add a shortcut that doesn't exist? We can do that.
- Marker remembers where you left off last. Each time you re-open Marker it'll pick up where you left off so it's easy to remember what you were last working on.
- Notes are saved in non-proprietary markdown files. Metadata is stored in it's own file so you have full control over your notes.
- No telemetry. We respect your privacy.
- No bloat UI that lets you focus on what matters most. Your notes.

# Install

As of right now Marker only supports linux. We offer both `.deb`, and `rpm` files of all our releases.
